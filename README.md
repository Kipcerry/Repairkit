This script adds a realistic repair kit and tyre kit system with item durability support.

Players can repair damaged vehicles using a repair kit, with repair time and effectiveness fully configurable. Each use reduces the item’s durability, meaning repair kits and tyres are consumable over time instead of single-use items.

When enabled, tyres must be repaired individually using tyre kits, adding extra realism. Special handling is included for Cayo Perico, where vehicles can be fully repaired regardless of tyre damage.
